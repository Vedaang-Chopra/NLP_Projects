## **7. Attention Mechanisms and Transformers**

### **Beginner Level**

### **Introduction to Attention Mechanisms**

**Theoretical Concepts:**

Attention mechanisms allow neural networks to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each part of the output, improving performance on tasks like translation and summarization.

- **Motivation:**
    - Overcome limitations of fixed-size context vectors in encoder-decoder models.
- **Basic Idea:**
    - Assign weights (attention scores) to different parts of the input.
- **Mathematical Representation:**
    - **Attention Score:**eij​=a(si−1​,hj​)
        
        eij=a(si−1,hj)e_{ij} = a(s_{i-1}, h_j)
        
        - si−1s_{i-1}si−1​: Decoder's previous hidden state
        - hjh_jhj​: Encoder's hidden state
        - aaa: Alignment model (e.g., dot product, additive)
    - **Attention Weights (Softmax):**αij​=∑k​exp(eik​)exp(eij​)​
        
        αij=exp⁡(eij)∑kexp⁡(eik)\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k} \exp(e_{ik})}
        
    - **Context Vector:**ci​=∑j​αij​hj​

    LCLM​=−t=1∑T​logP(wt​∣w<t​;θ)
        
        LCLM=−∑t=1Tlog⁡P(wt∣w<t;θ)L_{\text{CLM}} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(w_t | w_{<t}; \theta)
